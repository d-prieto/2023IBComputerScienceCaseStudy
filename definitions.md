## Cloud Computing

**Definition:** delivering hosted services over the internet, providing on-demand computer resources like data storage and computing power.

The name _cloud computing_ was inspired by the cloud symbol that's often used to represent the internet in flowcharts and diagrams.

===========================================

**DELIVERY MODELS:**

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):** supplys specific resources needed to run applications through the cloud. Used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications and (a limited control of) networking components. (EXAMPLES: Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine)

**Platform as a service (PaaS):** allows web pages to run by providing storage, networking and configuration. Cloud providers host development tools on their infrastructures and users access these tools over the internet using APIs, web portals,... The resources are more abstracted than in IaaS. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. (EXAMPLES: Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine)

**Software as a service (SaaS):** delivers software applications over the internet, also called web services. The applications then run directly in the browswer and can be accessed by the user from any location using a computer or mobile device that has internet access. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including or even individual application capabilities, except for user-specific application configuration settings. (EXAMPLES: Netflix, Google Docs)
